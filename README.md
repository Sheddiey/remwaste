# Redesign of Skip Selection Page

## Introduction

This README explains how I redesigned the skip selection page on [wewantwaste.co.uk](https://wewantwaste.co.uk).

---

## 1. Reviewing the Existing Page

1. I opened the skip selection page.
2. I noted what worked and what could be improved.

---

## 2. Taking Notes on Improvements

While reviewing, I wrote down points such as:

- No dark/light theme toggle.
- Cards lacked clear data placement.
- Progress bar could be clearer.

---

## 3. Redesigning in Figma

1. Created a Figma file to sketch updated versions.
2. Designed:

   - Cards with better placement of size, price, and duration.
   - A toggle for light and dark themes.
   - An improved progress bar that shows completed, current, and upcoming steps.

3. Shared the Figma link below.
